# Emotion-detection-by-text
Detect the emotion of the people by text messages
# Emotion Detection by Text Analysis
This repository contains code for detecting emotions in text using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

# About the Project
The project aims to classify text data into different emotion categories such as happy, sad, angry, etc. using machine learning or deep learning models.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation contains text samples labeled with corresponding emotions. It may include a variety of sources such as social media posts, customer reviews, or labeled datasets specific to emotion detection.

# Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

# Clone the repository:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
# Install the required Python packages:
sh
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn tensorflow  # Add any additional packages as needed
# Usage
Place your dataset file in the project directory.
Update the file path in the code to load your dataset.
Choose and train a machine learning or deep learning model for emotion detection.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
Deploy the trained model for inference on new text data.
