## 📋 Introduction  

This project is designed to classify text into various emotional categories like **happy**, **sad**, **angry**, and more. By leveraging **machine learning** or **deep learning models**, the project provides insights into emotional states based on textual data.  

---

## 🎯 Features  

- **🌟 Emotion Classification:** Accurately detects emotions from input text.  
- **📊 Customizable Models:** Choose from machine learning or deep learning approaches.  
- **📈 Performance Metrics:** Evaluate models with standard metrics for improved accuracy.  
- **🖥️ Deployable:** Easily deploy the model for real-time emotion detection.  

---

## 🗂️ Dataset  

The dataset contains labeled text samples representing various emotions. Data sources may include:  
- **📱 Social media posts**  
- **📝 Customer reviews**  
- **📂 Public emotion datasets**  

Add your dataset to the `data/` directory to get started.

## ⚙️ Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MRizwanMalik/Emotion-detection-by-text.git
   ```  

2. Navigate to the project directory:  

   ```bash
   cd Emotion-detection-by-text
   ```  

3. Install the required Python packages:  

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

---

## 🚀 Usage  

1. **Prepare the Dataset:** Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.  
2. **Update File Path:** Update the dataset file path in the preprocessing script.  
3. **Train the Model:** Use the `model_training.py` script to train a machine learning or deep learning model.  

   ```bash
   python src/model_training.py
   ```  

4. **Evaluate Performance:** Run evaluations to check accuracy and other metrics.  
5. **Make Predictions:** Use `inference.py` to predict emotions from new text data.  

   ```bash
   python src/inference.py --input "Your text here"
   ```
